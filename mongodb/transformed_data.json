If you find yourself think about those questions, this is the course for you. We will start from some basic building blocks of finance, such as time value of money and discounting, and proceed to look at some of the important financial controversies you have read or heard in the pop culture or media.

The second part provides a general introduction to the principles of continuum fluid mechanics. The basic conservation laws are derived in both differential and integral forms using different fluid models, and the link between the two is demonstrated. Applications covered include: dimensional analysis, hydrostatics, flow visualization, incompressible and compressible frictionless flows, the speed of sound, the momentum principle, viscous flows and selected examples of real fluid flows. The students conduct two hands-on laboratory experiments involving microfluidics and flow visualization, which complement the fluid mechanics lectures and experience technical report writing.",

It seeks to foster a critical approach to the way in which the world is organized. A dual mission stands at its centre: it utilizes a focus on capitalism as a tool of scholarly understanding of the way the world has evolved, and it assists students in developing a critique of capitalism as a system.",

It then considers local and federal responses to economic catastrophe, emphasizing the emergence of regulatory mechanisms that further reshaped social relations. With this foundation in place, the course turns to consider three forms of artistic production in which the social dynamics of the age found powerful echo: FSA photography and WPA murals; experimental literature; and cinema.",

This course introduces students to some classic attempts at addressing this question with specific reference to the nature of personhood and social life. By engaging with the writings of Marx, Weber, Freud, and DeBeauvoir among other great thinkers of the modern age, students will develop deeper knowledge of the major theories guiding anthropological research. We will pay close attention to how arguments are constructed in these texts and focus on the methodologies that these pioneers of social thought developed in their inquiries. The course covers enduring topics ranging from the production of social inequality, what it means to be an individual, how collective life is shaped by economic markets, and the role of religion in shaping human experience, to develop an understanding of central issues facing the world today.

Practical component of the field school takes place on the UTM campus during the last two weeks of August (Monday-Friday 9:00 am – 5:00 pm). Morning lectures (week one) covering note taking, map making, cultural landscapes, material culture identification and survey and excavation methods, are followed by afternoons in the field applying skills taught that morning. Week two is spent excavating at an archaeological site. During weekly laboratory sessions September – December students learn to process, identify, and catalogue artifacts recovered during the field component.

This demographic shift suggests that for many (if not most) people, their primary encounter with “nature” will be urban-based. This course explores \"the city\" through a multispecies lens and challenges assumptions about the human-centeredness (anthropocentrism) of urban places. In this course students are invited to utilize a variety of approaches, including arts-based ethnography, journaling, archival research, photography, sound-scaping, et al., as we explore the following questions: How do ideas about nature-culture shape our interactions with nonhumans in cities? How do built environments structure human-nonhuman relationships in urban spaces? How have human-nonhuman interactions changed over time in cities? How can we foster more compassionate and caring relationships with nonhumans in cities - and how might we do this in the context of social-ecological injustices and climate change? What might a thriving multispecies city of the future look like?",

This course integrates research findings from human sleep studies, the ethnographic record, and the ecology and evolution of mammalian and primate sleep to better understand sleep along the human lineage and in the modern world. Students will learn how to use 'wearable' technology, such as actigraphy, for scientific research. The goal of the course is to empower students with the theoretical and technological tools to be able to not only critically assess their own sleep-wake behaviour and performance but also popular generalizations about how to maximize long-term health outcomes.",

It explores evolutionary and biological approaches to understanding human health by examining the concepts of adaptation and plasticity, genetic and epigenetic approaches, developmental origins and life history theories, social determinants of health, and critical medical anthropology.

This course spans anthropology of autism and critical autism studies, examining autism as both lived experience and rubric for a complex set of biosocial and cultural phenomena. Engaging with academic and popular texts and multi-media sources, we explore how knowledge of autism is socially produced in historical, political and cultural contexts; autobiographies and ethnographies of autistic lives; histories of autistic organising; and autism and intersectionality, attending particularly to race and gender.",

What kinds of questions have social and cultural anthropologists asked when faced with the diversity of a region that stretches from North Africa to West Asia? This course explores the cultural, historical, and political complexity of the region from an ethnographic perspective, while also attending critically to the way “The Middle East” has been constructed in the first place. Rather than attempting an overview of the entire region, it focuses on themes that have compelled anthropological research in the area in recent decades, including but not limited to war, migration, labour, “terrorism”, gender, racialization, and religion. We will draw from key academic texts in conversation with other genres of knowledge production including film, journalism, and literature. No previous familiarity with the region is required.",

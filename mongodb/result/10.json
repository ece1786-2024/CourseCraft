Students will be placed, either as individuals, in partners, or in teams, with a government, non-profit or community advocacy group to collaboratively address a specific problem or need of the organization. In classroom discussions, and in assignments students will have an opportunity to reflect critically on their experiences, explore social and ethical issues, and integrate placements with course readings in ways that mobilize or perhaps challenge academic knowledge. Assignments will integrate practice in a range of forms of expression (for instance personal story, policy brief, podcast, interview, news release, or blog) to support the development of the range of expressive skills needed to support working for change.

It is estimated that by 2030 over 60% will be urban dwellers. This demographic shift suggests that for many (if not most) people, their primary encounter with “nature” will be urban-based. This course explores \"the city\" through a multispecies lens and challenges assumptions about the human-centeredness (anthropocentrism) of urban places. In this course students are invited to utilize a variety of approaches, including arts-based ethnography, journaling, archival research, photography, sound-scaping, et al., as we explore the following questions: How do ideas about nature-culture shape our interactions with nonhumans in cities? How do built environments structure human-nonhuman relationships in urban spaces? How have human-nonhuman interactions changed over time in cities? How can we foster more compassionate and caring relationships with nonhumans in cities - and how might we do this in the context of social-ecological injustices and climate change? What might a thriving multispecies city of the future look like?","title":"The Natural City: Cultural Approaches to Urban Sustainability","levelOfInstruction":"undergraduate","prerequisitesText":"<p>ANT204H5 or ANT207H5 or ENV100Y5 or permission of department</p>","corequisitesText":null,"exclusionsText":null,"recommendedPreparation":null,"note":null,"division":"University of Toronto Mississauga","breadthRequirements":null,"distributionRequirements":["Social Science"],"publicationSections":["UTM - Anthropology"],"cmPublicationSections":[{"section":"UTM - Anthropology","subSections":null}]},"created":"2024-11-16@19:26:42.130","modified":null,"lastSaved":0,"primaryTeachMethod":"LEC","faculty":{"code":"ERIN","name":"University of Toronto Mississauga"},"coSec":{"code":"","name":null},"department":{"code":"ANTRL","name":"Department of Anthropology"},"title":null,"maxCredit":0.50,"minCredit":0.50,"breadths":[{"org":{"code":"APSC","name":"Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering"},"breadthTypes":[{"kind":"ELECTIVE","type":"Compl Studies","description":"Complementary Studies","code":"CS"}]},{"org":{"code":"ERIN","name":"University of Toronto Mississauga"},"breadthTypes":[{"kind":"DISTRIBUTION","type":"Social Science","description":"Social Science","code":"SSc"}]},{"org":{"code":"SCAR","name":"University of Toronto Scarborough"},"breadthTypes":[]}],"notes":[],"cancelInd":"","subscriptionTtb":false,"subscriptionOpenData":false,"tb1Active":false,"tb2Active":false,"primaryWaitlistable":false,"fullyOnline":false,"primaryFull":false},{"id":"66193fb80b7d9d3dbe57e5ee","name":"Rethinking Development, or the Improvement of the World","ucName":null,"code":"ANT374H1","sectionCode":"F","campus":"St. George","sessions":["20249"],"sections":[{"name":"LEC0101","type":"Lecture","teachMethod":"LEC","sectionNumber":"0101","meetingTimes":[{"start":{"day":3,"millisofday":39600000},"end":{"day":3,"millisofday":46800000},"building":{"buildingCode":"SS","buildingRoomNumber":"","buildingRoomSuffix":"","buildingUrl":"https://map.utoronto.ca/?id=1809#!m/494510","buildingName":null},"sessionCode":"20249","repetition":"WEEKLY","repetitionTime":"ONCE_A_WEEK"}],"firstMeeting":null,"instructors":[{"firstName":"Nicholas","lastName":"Abrams"}],"currentEnrolment":43,"maxEnrolment":60,"subTitle":"","cancelInd":"N","waitlistInd":"Y","deliveryModes":[{"session":"20249","mode":"INPER"}],"currentWaitlist":0,"enrolmentInd":"P","tbaInd":"N","openLimitInd":"N","notes":[{"name":"Section Note","type":"SECTION","content":""}],"enrolmentControls":[{"yearOfStudy":"*","post":{"code":"","name":""},"subject":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"subjectPost":{"code":"","name":""},"typeOfProgram":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"designation":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"primaryOrg":{"code":"ARCLA","name":"John H.

It explores the evolution of growth patterns among primates and hominins and compares patterns of growth among the living primates. The course examines human growth and development throughout infancy, childhood, and adolescence and explores the influence of genetic, epigenetic, and endocrine processes on the plasticity of human growth that ultimately produces the variability observed in our species. The goal of the course is to provide students with a complex understanding of how evolutionary and environmental processes interact in the production of growth and health in human populations.","title":"Anthropology of Growth and Development","levelOfInstruction":"undergraduate","prerequisitesText":"(ANT202H5 or ANT203H5) and ANT220H5","corequisitesText":"","exclusionsText":"","recommendedPreparation":"","note":null,"division":"University of Toronto Mississauga","breadthRequirements":null,"distributionRequirements":["Science"],"publicationSections":["UTM - Anthropology"],"cmPublicationSections":[{"section":"UTM - Anthropology","subSections":null}]},"created":"2024-11-03@22:13:44.222","modified":null,"lastSaved":0,"primaryTeachMethod":"LEC","faculty":{"code":"ERIN","name":"University of Toronto Mississauga"},"coSec":{"code":"","name":null},"department":{"code":"ANTRL","name":"Department of Anthropology"},"title":null,"maxCredit":0.50,"minCredit":0.50,"breadths":[{"org":{"code":"APSC","name":"Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering"},"breadthTypes":[{"kind":"ELECTIVE","type":"Compl Studies","description":"Complementary Studies","code":"CS"}]},{"org":{"code":"ERIN","name":"University of Toronto Mississauga"},"breadthTypes":[{"kind":"DISTRIBUTION","type":"Science","description":"Science","code":"Sci"},{"kind":"DISTRIBUTION","type":"Social Science","description":"Social Science","code":"SSc"}]},{"org":{"code":"SCAR","name":"University of Toronto Scarborough"},"breadthTypes":[]}],"notes":[],"cancelInd":"","subscriptionTtb":false,"subscriptionOpenData":false,"tb1Active":false,"tb2Active":false,"fullyOnline":false,"primaryFull":false,"primaryWaitlistable":false},{"id":"66193fb80b7d9d3dbe57e5e6","name":"Molecular Anthropology and Human Evolution","ucName":null,"code":"ANT338H1","sectionCode":"F","campus":"St. George","sessions":["20249"],"sections":[{"name":"TUT0201","type":"Tutorial","teachMethod":"TUT","sectionNumber":"0201","meetingTimes":[{"start":{"day":2,"millisofday":57600000},"end":{"day":2,"millisofday":61200000},"building":{"buildingCode":"NF","buildingRoomNumber":"","buildingRoomSuffix":"","buildingUrl":"https://map.utoronto.ca/?id=1809#!m/494600","buildingName":null},"sessionCode":"20249","repetition":"WEEKLY","repetitionTime":"ONCE_A_WEEK"}],"firstMeeting":null,"instructors":[],"currentEnrolment":8,"maxEnrolment":19,"subTitle":"","cancelInd":"N","waitlistInd":"N","deliveryModes":[{"session":"20249","mode":"INPER"}],"currentWaitlist":0,"enrolmentInd":"","tbaInd":"N","openLimitInd":"N","notes":[{"name":"Section Note","type":"SECTION","content":"<p>September 5, 2024: Room changed.</p>"}],"enrolmentControls":[{"yearOfStudy":"*","post":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"subject":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"subjectPost":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"typeOfProgram":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"designation":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"primaryOrg":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"associatedOrg":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"secondOrg":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"adminOrg":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"collaborativeOrgGroupCode":"*","quantity":19,"sequence":1}],"linkedMeetingSections":null},{"name":"TUT0101","type":"Tutorial","teachMethod":"TUT","sectionNumber":"0101","meetingTimes":[{"start":{"day":2,"millisofday":54000000},"end":{"day":2,"millisofday":57600000},"building":{"buildingCode":"VC","buildingRoomNumber":"","buildingRoomSuffix":"","buildingUrl":"https://map.utoronto.ca/?id=1809#!m/494602","buildingName":null},"sessionCode":"20249","repetition":"WEEKLY","repetitionTime":"ONCE_A_WEEK"}],"firstMeeting":null,"instructors":[],"currentEnrolment":29,"maxEnrolment":30,"subTitle":"","cancelInd":"N","waitlistInd":"N","deliveryModes":[{"session":"20249","mode":"INPER"}],"currentWaitlist":0,"enrolmentInd":"","tbaInd":"N","openLimitInd":"N","notes":[{"name":"Section Note","type":"SECTION","content":""}],"enrolmentControls":[{"yearOfStudy":"*","post":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"subject":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"subjectPost":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"typeOfProgram":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"designation":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"primaryOrg":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"associatedOrg":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"secondOrg":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"adminOrg":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"collaborativeOrgGroupCode":"*","quantity":30,"sequence":1}],"linkedMeetingSections":null},{"name":"LEC0101","type":"Lecture","teachMethod":"LEC","sectionNumber":"0101","meetingTimes":[{"start":{"day":2,"millisofday":46800000},"end":{"day":2,"millisofday":54000000},"building":{"buildingCode":"VC","buildingRoomNumber":"","buildingRoomSuffix":"","buildingUrl":"https://map.utoronto.ca/?id=1809#!m/494602","buildingName":null},"sessionCode":"20249","repetition":"WEEKLY","repetitionTime":"ONCE_A_WEEK"}],"firstMeeting":null,"instructors":[{"firstName":"T.

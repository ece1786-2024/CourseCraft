We'll consider how appeals to ‘the people’ mobilize rage and resentment, dig into populism's progressive Black roots and interrogate the techniques which pit the 'average American' against putatively corrupt institutions and privileged elites. Along the way, we'll read a range historical and contemporary populist texts, from Alexander Hamilton's letters railing against demagoguery, to Occupy Wall Street's aspirational post-capitalist tweets, to the National Rifle Association's TV show 'Armed and Fabulous' and contemporary country music's 'pickup truck' populism.</p>"}],"cancelInd":"N","subscriptionTtb":false,"subscriptionOpenData":false,"tb1Active":false,"tb2Active":false,"fullyOnline":false,"primaryFull":false,"primaryWaitlistable":false},{"id":"66193fb80b7d9d3dbe57e5c7","name":"Topics in American Studies","ucName":null,"code":"AMS402H1","sectionCode":"S","campus":"St. George","sessions":["20251"],"sections":[{"name":"LEC0101","type":"Lecture","teachMethod":"LEC","sectionNumber":"0101","meetingTimes":[{"start":{"day":4,"millisofday":50400000},"end":{"day":4,"millisofday":57600000},"building":{"buildingCode":"FE","buildingRoomNumber":"","buildingRoomSuffix":"","buildingUrl":"https://map.utoronto.ca/?id=1809#!m/494550","buildingName":null},"sessionCode":"20251","repetition":"WEEKLY","repetitionTime":"ONCE_A_WEEK"}],"firstMeeting":null,"instructors":[],"currentEnrolment":5,"maxEnrolment":20,"subTitle":"Stormy Weather: American Natural Disasters","cancelInd":"N","waitlistInd":"Y","deliveryModes":[{"session":"20251","mode":"INPER"}],"currentWaitlist":0,"enrolmentInd":"P","tbaInd":"N","openLimitInd":"N","notes":[{"name":"Section Note","type":"SECTION","content":"<p>July 9, 2024: Course added.</p>"}],"enrolmentControls":[{"yearOfStudy":"*","post":{"code":"","name":""},"subject":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"subjectPost":{"code":"ASMAJ0135","name":"American Studies Major"},"typeOfProgram":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"designation":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"primaryOrg":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"associatedOrg":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"secondOrg":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"adminOrg":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"collaborativeOrgGroupCode":"*","quantity":20,"sequence":1},{"yearOfStudy":"*","post":{"code":"","name":""},"subject":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"subjectPost":{"code":"ASMIN0135","name":"American Studies Minor"},"typeOfProgram":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"designation":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"primaryOrg":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"associatedOrg":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"secondOrg":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"adminOrg":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"collaborativeOrgGroupCode":"*","quantity":20,"sequence":2},{"yearOfStudy":"*","post":{"code":"","name":""},"subject":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"subjectPost":{"code":"","name":""},"typeOfProgram":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"designation":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"primaryOrg":{"code":"ARTSC","name":"Faculty of Arts and Science"},"associatedOrg":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"secondOrg":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"adminOrg":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"collaborativeOrgGroupCode":"*","quantity":20,"sequence":3},{"yearOfStudy":"*","post":{"code":"","name":""},"subject":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"subjectPost":{"code":"","name":""},"typeOfProgram":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"designation":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"primaryOrg":{"code":"ARCLA","name":"John H.

This course will explore the consequences of how America imagines and represents such cataclysms. We’ll examine what happens when weather disasters are viewed as temporary aberrations or, alternatively, seen as a disturbing new normal in the long emergency of climate change. To get at these issues, we'll draw on the deep cultural archive of American disaster narratives. We'll listen to Charley Patton sing the Mississippi Delta flood blues, look at Banksy's graffiti art in post-Katrina New Orleans, and watch The Rock rescue California in the blockbuster film 'San Andreas' - all as we consider just how unnatural 'natural' disaster really is.&nbsp;</p><p>For full course descriptions, please visit our website: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://munkschool.utoronto.ca/american-studies/courses\">https://munkschool.utoronto.ca/american-studies/courses</a>.&nbsp;</p>"}],"cancelInd":"N","subscriptionTtb":false,"subscriptionOpenData":false,"tb1Active":false,"tb2Active":false,"fullyOnline":false,"primaryFull":false,"primaryWaitlistable":false},{"id":"66193fb80b7d9d3dbe57e5c9","name":"Independent Studies","ucName":null,"code":"AMS494H1","sectionCode":"F","campus":"St. George","sessions":["20249"],"sections":[{"name":"LEC0101","type":"Lecture","teachMethod":"LEC","sectionNumber":"0101","meetingTimes":[],"firstMeeting":null,"instructors":[],"currentEnrolment":0,"maxEnrolment":9999,"subTitle":"","cancelInd":"N","waitlistInd":"N","deliveryModes":[{"session":"20249","mode":"INPER"}],"currentWaitlist":0,"enrolmentInd":"E","tbaInd":"Y","openLimitInd":"N","notes":[{"name":"Section Note","type":"SECTION","content":""}],"enrolmentControls":[{"yearOfStudy":"*","post":{"code":"","name":""},"subject":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"subjectPost":{"code":"ASMAJ0135","name":"American Studies Major"},"typeOfProgram":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"designation":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"primaryOrg":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"associatedOrg":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"secondOrg":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"adminOrg":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"collaborativeOrgGroupCode":"*","quantity":9999,"sequence":1},{"yearOfStudy":"*","post":{"code":"","name":""},"subject":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"subjectPost":{"code":"ASMIN0135","name":"American Studies Minor"},"typeOfProgram":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"designation":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"primaryOrg":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"associatedOrg":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"secondOrg":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"adminOrg":{"code":"*","name":"All"},"collaborativeOrgGroupCode":"*","quantity":9999,"sequence":2}],"linkedMeetingSections":null}],"duration":null,"cmCourseInfo":{"description":"Independent Studies.
